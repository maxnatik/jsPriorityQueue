/**
 * Fast implementation of priority queue / min-heap with C#-like interface.
 * Represents a collection of items that have a value and a priority.
 * On dequeue, the item with the lowest priority value is removed.
 *
 * @typeParam T - Specifies the type of elements in the queue.
 *
 * @remarks Implements based on an array-backed, k-ary min-heap after studying
 * {@link https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0252} and {@link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-ary-heap/}
 * and some investigations of optimize for js. Primary goal was create ultra-fast js-native
 * queue for general purpose shortest path problem algorithm. Pairing heap may be still
 * faster than k-ary heap, further investigation will be.
 *
 * About performance: queue faster than other implementations e.g. {@link https://github.com/ignlg/heap-js}
 * from about 1.5x on low-depth (< 1000 elements) > 10:1 enqueue : dequeue mix workload
 * to about 8x-10x on 10^7 depth queue with 2:1 1:1 mix workload. Real-world boost is excepted 3x performance
 * on short-live queue. Optimal value of k in most scearios is 4. But feel free to increase to 8 or even 16.
 *
 * Speed up cost some limitations and expenses. Therefore this queue consumes additional memory, doesnt
 * free it, support only real-valued priority and work as min-heap. So, some tips:
 *
 * - After long sequence of dequeue operations good think to use {@link shrink} funcrion to free space if
 * you mind continue work with queue.
 * - If you need reverse ordering, you may multiply priority by -1.
